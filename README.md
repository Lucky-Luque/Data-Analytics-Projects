# Data-Analytics-Projects

## Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

For this project, we'll pretend we're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. We make our apps available on Google Play and in the App Store.

We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the number of users of our apps determines our revenue for any given app â€” the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better.

Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.

## Exploring Hacker News Posts

In this project, we'll work with a dataset of submissions to popular technology site Hacker News.

Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") receive votes and comments, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:
- Do Ask or Show posts receive more comments on average?
- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
