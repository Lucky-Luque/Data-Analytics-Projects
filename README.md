## Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

For this project, I pretended I was working as a data analyst for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. We make our apps available on Google Play and in the App Store.

We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the number of users of our apps determines our revenue for any given app â€” the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better.

Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.

## Exploring Hacker News Posts

In this project, I worked with a dataset of submissions to popular technology site Hacker News.

We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:
- Do Ask or Show posts receive more comments on average?
- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

## Exploring eBay Car Sales Data

In this project, I worked with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.

The aim of this project is to clean the dataset and perform some initial analysis on it.

## Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94

For this project, I analyzed a dataset about the westbound traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway.

The goal of the analysis is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc. For instance, we may find out that the traffic is usually heavier in the summer or when it snows.

## Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates

The dataset in this project describes Euro daily exchange rates between 1999 and 2021.

We will create a storytelling data visualization to answer the following questions:
- Show how the euro-dollar rate changed during the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
- Show comparatively how the euro-dollar rate changed under the last three US presidents.
